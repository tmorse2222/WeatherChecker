SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly<br>
<br>
Acceptance Criteria:<br>
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br>

This challenge tasked us with creating a weather application that is capable of retrieving data from third-party servers. All documents were coded from scratch, featuring the use of bootstrap and custom css for styling and use of Jquery and custom JS to achieve functionality. The application pulls from 4 different server-side APIs; Geocoding, Current weather, and 5 day forcast from openweathermap.org, and UV info from openuv.io.
